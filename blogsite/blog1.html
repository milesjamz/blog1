<h1>IRC - Internet Relay Chat</h1>
<br><br><br>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<p>IRC is an easy way to communicate online with people all over the world.</p>
		<p>It was invented in 1988 by <a href = "jarkko.gif">Jarkko Oikarinen</a> in 1988, in Finland, at the University of Oulu. It was intended to be used alongside the <a href = "bbs.html">BBS</a>es which were a precursor to the World Wide Web.</p>

	<h2>How does it work?</h2>

		<p>IRC is an <a href = "layers.png">application layer protocol.</a> Users install IRC clients on their computers, which are used to connect to servers, which are themselves part of networks. IRC Servers run software(generally called IRC <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon">Daemons</a>) which recieve messages from users' clients, then relays those messages to other clients on the same server network.</p>

		<p>There are many different IRC networks, and they don't connect to each other - so users on one network can't communicate with users on other networks. This helps to keep network sizes small, which reduces lag and the occurrences of "net splits."</p>

		<p>Currently, one of the largest networks is called "freenode", and is dedicated towards people making free, open source software - there are channels like #ruby, #javascript, and #bash(and things like #ancientgreek).</p>
	<h2>How do you use it?</h2>

		<p>After downloading an <a href = "http://www.irchelp.org/clients/mac/">IRC client</a>, you find a local server that connects to a network. Once logged in, you assign yourself a nickname, which is a user handle. Networks contain channels, which are chat rooms. Channel names are prefixed with #hashtags. Additionally, most channels have Channel Operators, users who have the ability to kick out and ban abusive users from the channel, as well as set the "topic" of conversation of the channel - these Channel Operators have @At symbols in front of their names.</p>

		<p>Channels are created when the first user joins them, and disappear when the last user leaves. In order to allow channels to persist even when no-one is currently in them, people scripted bots, which permanently live in a given channel. These bots can recognize channel operators and can also provide other services, like provide information related to the channel, maintain lists of banned users, and miscellaneous things like offering trivia or other games. Many of these bots were scripted in perl or tcl, but a popular Windows IRC client called mIRC has its own scripting language, called mSL.</p>
		<p>IRC also allows for directly messaging people, as well as sharing files peer-to-peer.</p>

	<h2>Why should I care?</h2>
		<p>IRC offers a glimpse into alternative ways of internet communication that predate our current platforms, dominated by large corporations which mine and sell our data, invade our privacy, and drive us crazy. It also has served as a valuable way of communicating in areas where government media was censored; for instance, in the middle east during the Gulf War, and in Russia during the breakup of the USSR. In this vein, it continues to be used today in more remote parts of the world.

	<h2>Nah, I'll pass - This Seems Like A Nerdy Old Fashioned Thing I'm Way Too Cool For</h2>
		<p>Even though things like IRC seem outdated and not useful, they provided the template for many of the tools we use today. For instance, #channels, @users, DMs, etc... seem <a href = "www.slack.com">familiar?</a></p>
